<h2>The Sirens' Lullaby</h2>

<h3>You state that you're the first man to live through the Sirens. You recount how you had your men tie you to the mast of your ship and plug your ears. You talked about how they promised you knowledge on the history of the Trojan War. You recount how you were so incredibly tempted by the Sirens, but your crew pulled through and got you out of there safely.</h3>
