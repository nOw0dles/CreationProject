<h1>An Odyssey</h1>

<h2>You take out your knife and run towards the hut. You start ripping it apart. Calypso cries and begs you to stop. She tries to approach you but you threaten her with the knife. She backs down. You successfuly build a raft and set sail. Calypso calls out to you to come back. You ignore her.</h2>
<h2>Congrats. You made it off the island</h2>
