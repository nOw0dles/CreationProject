<h1>An Odyssey</h1>

<h2>Penelope suddenly comes out and surveys the room. Her eyes lock with yours and light up for a brief moment. You silence her with a sharp gaze and she seems to understand. She leaves and comes back with a bow and a set of arrows. You smile wide and can't help but feel proud of who you married.</h2>

<h2>She announces that whoever can shoot an arrow from this bow will be the one she marries. The fire in each man's eyes as they line up at a chance for her hand in marriage disappear as they hold the bow and find that they can not even pull back the string. You stand off to the side, staring at the spectacle in amusement. You already know that not one of these fools will be able to shoot an arrow from your trick bow.</h2>

<h2>In order to draw back the string, one must press a button 3 times.</h2>
