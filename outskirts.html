<h1>An Odyssey</h1>

<h2>Just outside of Ithaca, you meet a familiar face, Athena. You ask her what she's doing here. She says she always shows up when she hears of powerful women in trouble. You tell her that's your wife. Intrigued, she decides to share her plan and for free.</h2>

<h2>She tells you to diguise as a beggar and to attempt to court Penelope. If you and Penelope truly love each other, she will be able to recognize you. You agree to this plan. You ask her how you'll pass for a beggar. Athena is willing to disguise you as a beggar for 3000 coins. Do you accept her offer?</h2>

<a href="ABeggar.html">a. Yes, her disguise will probably be much more convincing</a>
<br>
<a href="OBeggar.html">b. No, you can make a decent disguise on your own.</a>
